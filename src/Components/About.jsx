        I work in product and I'm also a full stack web developer. 
        <br/>
        <br/>

        For the little story, I originally planned to do something totally different. I wanted to be a chemical engineer (!). However, after my second internship, I realized that although it was interesting, this was not something I was ready to dedicate my life to - Still, I graduated. 
        <br/>
        <br/>

        Anyhow, armed with my strong analytical and communication skills from my engineering degree, I started looking for a more meaningful career. I participated and won a few startups competitions, went through two incubators and I was hook to the startup life.

        <br/>

        In order to seriously break into the startup world I needed new skills so I decided to learn to program. I was accepted into Lambda School's full stack web development cohort in August 2019 and never looked back.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        My ultimate goal is to work as a product manager in a fast growing startup. I know I didn't need to be a developer to become a product manager, but learning how to program has given me a better understanding of how software works and will allowed me to work better with the engineers on my team.

        In the meantime, I am having fun building side-projects and writing about the (African) tech industry.
